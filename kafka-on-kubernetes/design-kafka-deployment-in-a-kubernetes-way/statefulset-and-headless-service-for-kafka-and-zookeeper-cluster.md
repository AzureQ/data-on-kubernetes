# Cluster: StatefulSet and Headless Service

![StatefulSet for Kafka and Zookeeper](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-05-28-at-7.30.07-pm.png)

[StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/), and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Like a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

[Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) is just like normal Kubernetes Services, except they donâ€™t do any load balancing. When combined with StatefulSets, they can give you unique DNS addresses that let you directly access the pods.

Below is an example of StatefulSet YAML  along with a [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services).

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <Headless Service Name>
  labels:
    <Labels>
spec:
  ports:
  - port: <Kafka Port>
    name: server
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    <K,V pair that should match Kafka StatefulSet>
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: <StatefulSet Name>
spec:
  serviceName: <Headless Service Name>
  replicas: <Number of Pods>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        <labels>
    spec:
      containers:
        <Containers Spec>
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  <Persistent Volume Claims>
```
